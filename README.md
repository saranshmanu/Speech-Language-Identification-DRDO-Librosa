# Speech-Language-Identification-DRDO-Librosa

The project is a part of my internship and the research project at the Defence Research and Development Organisation - Scientific Analysis Group where I have to classify the speech audio samples in various languages spoken in India. The project will involve various techniques involving certain techniques to analyse the waveform, reduce the noise and use Machine Learning techniques to classify the audio clip.
